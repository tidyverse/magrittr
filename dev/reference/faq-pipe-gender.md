# FAQ: What is the gender of the pipe?

In Magritte's original quote "Ceci n'est pas une pipe," the word "pipe"
is feminine. However the magrittr package quotes it as "Ceci n'est pas
un pipe," with a masculine "pipe." This lighthearted misappropriation is
intentional. Whereas the object represented in Magritte's painting (a
pipe that you can smoke) is feminine in the French language, a computer
pipe (which is an Anglicism in French) is masculine.
